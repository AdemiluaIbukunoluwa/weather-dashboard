# WEATHER DASHBOARD

## Overview
A weather dashboard that fetches data from a weather API, stores it in an Amazon S3 bucket and retreives the data for display

It combines the following devops principles:
- External API Integration (OpenWeather API)
- Cloud Storage (AWS S3)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Version Control (Git)
- Python Development
- Error Handling
- Environment Management

  ## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities
- Displays temperature (Â°F), humidity, and weather conditions
- Automatically stores weather data in AWS S3
- Supports multiple cities tracking
- Timestamps all data for historical tracking

## Technical Architecture
- Language: Python
- API: OpenWeather API
- Cloud Provider: AWS
- boto3 (AWS SDK)
- python-dotenv
- requests
